Hello, i'm Bahman Nikouei.
As a web developer, I have over 20 years of working experience in Programing languages, platforms and frameworks.
I have worked on developing and designing more than 800 web design projects with the role of backend, frontend as well as fullstack developers. Depending on the type of project, client needs, quality level and development time.
I have used CMS like WordPress, frontend languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and backend languages like Node.js, PHP and frameworks like React.js, Express.js, Bootstrap and libs like jQuery.
In addition, I have taught HsTML, CSS and JavaScript in parallel to working as a fullstack developer.
I am very interested in JavaScript and JAVA programming languages.

Best Regards,
Bahman Nikouei
